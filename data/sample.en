Broadcast translators for commercial stations are normally required to receive a signal from their parent full - service FM station over-the - air and retransmit solely within the region which should be covered by the main station . 
( This eliminates the need for a translator except in cases where the terrain shielding is a problem . ) 
This same restriction does not apply to non-commercial educational stations . 
Any non-commercial station , even one with no local or educational content to offer , can apply for an unlimited number of translators anywhere to be fed by any means ( including via satellite ) . 
The end result is a network of hundreds of small local transmitters , none of which broadcast ( and none of which can lawfully broadcast ) programming of interest to the local community .

First Neurath rejects isomorphism between language and reality as useless metaphysical speculation , which would call for explaining how words and sentences could represent things in the external world . 
Instead , Neurath proposed that language and reality coincide — that reality consists in simply the totality of previously verified sentences in the language , and " truth " of a sentence is about its relationship to the totality of already verified sentences . 
Either a sentence failing to " concord " ( or cohere ) with the totality of the sentences already verified , should be considered false , or that some of that totality 's propositions must in some way be modified . 
He thus views truth as a question of internal coherence of linguistic assertions , rather than anything to do with facts or other entities in the world . 
Moreover , the criterion of verification is to applied to the system as a whole ( see semantic holism ) and not to single sentences . 
Such ideas exercised a profound influence over the " holistic verificationism " of W.V.O. Quine .

On 13 December 2001 , a group of masked , armed men with fake IDs stormed the Parliament building in Delhi . 
The terrorists managed to kill several security guards , but the building was sealed off swiftly and security forces cornered and killed the men , who were later proven to be Pakistan nationals . 
Coming just three months after the September 11 attacks upon the United States , this fresh escalation instantly enraged the nation . 
Although the Government of Pakistan officially condemned the attack , Indian intelligence reports pointed the finger at a conspiracy rooted in Pakistan . 
Prime Minister Vajpayee ordered a mobilization of India 's military forces , and as many as 500,000 servicemen amassed along the international boundary bordering Punjab , Rajasthan , Gujarat and Kashmir . 
Pakistan responded with the same .

Rebecca Mader 's audition scene was a fake flashback and she was disappointed that it was not used for the show . 
The character 's name was spoiled months in advance of broadcast . 
Charlotte was originally envisioned as an American ; 
however , the writers preferred Mader 's natural English accent to her fake American accent and they changed Charlotte accordingly . 
" Losts writer - producers compared Mader to " a young Nicole Kidman " . 
During the casting process , Charlotte was described as a " successful academic " . 
It was falsely rumored that Kristen Bell was offered the role of Charlotte ; 
Bell had actually spoken to the producers about having a part , however , no role was offered to her . 
Despite never having seen " Lost " , Mader decided that she " was not going to leave [ the auditioning ] room until [ she ] made [ Lindelof and Cuse ] fall in love with [ her ] " . 
Mader subsequently began to watch the first three seasons of " Lost " and was watching the fourth episode when she received the news that she had been chosen for the role . 
In the next two to three weeks , Mader — who was then signed on as a recurring guest star — watched the rest of the first three seasons , watching the third season finale a matter of hours before she began shooting her first " Confirmed Dead " scene , in which Charlotte meets Locke and his group . 
Mader was told little about her character by the writer - producers , except that " she was sort of like a female Indiana Jones type " . 
Mader has found it challenging but fun to play a character with an unknown backstory and motives . 
Charlotte 's full name is Charlotte Staples Lewis , which is an homage to the author C.S. Lewis , best known for " The Chronicles of Narnia " and various books about Christianity . 
Lewis was one of Mader 's favorite authors as a child and found it " wicked " and " cool " for her character to be named after him .
